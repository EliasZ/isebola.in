# [isebola.in](http://isebola.in)

Simple website to check whether ebola is in some place.

Runs a ~~dirty~~ PHP script to communicate with Google's Geocoding service. Don't forget to fill `server/locations.json` with latest [ebola data set](https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola/blob/master/map_data/locations.geojson).
